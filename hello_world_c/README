Need to change include in hello_world.c to include path to SDL.h on your machine.

Also make sure SDL and all libraries are installed. 

Compile with gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c `/Users/Jessie/Desktop/SDL_PLT/SDL/build/sdl2-config --cflags --libs` if make doesn't work -- but obviously change paths (also change paths in makefile). 

run with ./hello world

Move rectangle with up/down/left/right keys.
